The task is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the SUCCess rate of
startups based on various attributes and features. Startup SUCCeSS rate prediction involves
analyzing factors such as funding, team composition, industry, market trends, and other
relevant variables to estimate the likelihood of a startup's SUCCeSS. The goal is to create a
model that can accurately predict the SUCCess or failure of startups, assisting
entrepreneurs, investors, and stakeholders in making informed decisions.
