The objective of this project is to create an email spam detection system that uses
machine learning algorithms to classify incoming emails. By training the model on a
labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails, we aim to develop an accurate and
efficient spam detector that can reliably identify and categorize emails based on their
content and characteristics.
